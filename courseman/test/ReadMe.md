CourseMan Test Project 
=========================

Represents an independent app project that references the standard `jda-eg-courseman` project as the parent. This has the advantage of inheriting all the standard JDA dependencies. 

## Prerequisites
To use the JDA's components in the code, ensure to clone and `mvn install` the JDA repository before running this project.
